### What I Do When I'm Not Coding
- 🐱 Explaining to my cats why they can't sit on my keyboard while I'm coding
- 💪 Contemplating whether to go to the gym or not (spoiler: the couch usually wins)
- 🍓 Binging on blueberries and strawberries and edamame beans like there's no tomorrow
  
### My Projects 🚀
Here's a selection of some projects that I swear were bug-free when I last checked:
#### 📰 NC News
A full-stack news aggregation platform where you can rate, comment, and discuss news articles. Basically, Reddit but with fewer trolls (hopefully). Built with React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and PostgreSQL. [Check it out here!](https://github.com/natccc/fe-nc-news)

#### 🐶 DogGO
A mobile app for planning pet-friendly trips. If you see a dog on a beach in your next vacation, you can thank me. Built with React Native, Expo, TypeScript, and Supabase. [Take a look!](https://github.com/natccc/doggo)
